Create and/or modify classes to store information about various types of vehicles.

## Instructions

You are building a transportation application, and its primary purpose is to calculate travel times over certain distances.  You are working on an existing class called `Vehicle`.  It is stored in `vehicle.rb` in this folder.

You may infer from looking at the file that the vehicle in question is a Car.  Your task is to extend this code so that it can also return valid information about the following types of vehicles:

* Electric cars, which have 1 gear.
* Hybrid cars, which have 2 engines.
* Motorcycles, which have 2 wheels.
* Planes, which have 6 wheels, 2 engines, 1 gear, and 2 wings.
* Bicycles, which have no engines, 2 wheels and a number of gears specified when the bicycle is initialized.
