You will be making a webpage in Codepen that looks exactly like this:\r\n\r\n![Task 1 Screenshot](https://tiy-learn-content.s3.amazonaws.com/3fa02dcc-sonnet.png)\r\n\r\nSo that you don't have to re-type the whole thing, [here is the sonnet in text form](http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/174354).  Pay attention to all the details, from color to font to borders.  Look down in the resources section for a tool that will help you compare your work with this image.\r\n\r\n#### Task 2\r\n\r\nThe second task is to make the following button:\r\n\r\n![Task 2 Screenshot](https://tiy-learn-content.s3.amazonaws.com/828c7701-button.png)\r\n\r\nThe trick here is that you have to do all the work in CSS.  Your HTML must look exactly like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<span id=\"checkout\">Checkout</span>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou'll need to look up and understand CSS \"pseudo-selectors\" to get this to work.  You'll probably also get confused about how to do things like multiple borders.  As with everything you don't know in software development, the best approach is to Google for something like \"CSS multiple borders\" and find a good post that describes how it can be done.\r\n\r\nAgain, make this pixel-perfect!\r\n\r\n## Hard Mode\r\n\r\nTake a look at your GitHub repositories page.  [Here is an example](https://github.com/rposborne?tab=repositories).\r\n\r\nThere's a lot going on on this page, but it's not ridiculous.  For hard mode, recreate this page with as much precision as you can, but don't worry about getting all the information on the page right.  Just start at the top and try to create the menu bar, then work on the left column, then try the right.  Say gibberish if you would like, but DO NOT copy and paste anything from GitHub's source.\r\n\r\n## Nightmare Mode\r\n\r\nThe third task is much, much harder, but if you'd like to really learn a lot about HTML and CSS, try to reproduce the following webpage:\r\n\r\n![Nightmare Mode Screenshot](https://tiy-learn-content.s3.amazonaws.com/947b2cfa-surf_and_paddle.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nTo get this to work, you'll need to use a liberal number of nested divs, and will have to understand concepts like CSS positioning and CSS floating.  But really, don't keep yourself up late on Nightmare Mode.  This is just for those with extra time who want to poke around more (and it's a full Front End Engineering assignment in itself.)\r\n\r\n## Additional Resources\r\n\r\n* Mac's built-in screenshoting tool (Command + Shift + 4, then draw a box around what you want). __IF you use dropbox, it can automatically store these, and add them to your clipboard for easy pasting.\r\n* [Sip.app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sip/id507257563?mt=12) for picking colors.\r\n* [PerfectPixel](http://www.welldonecode.com/perfectpixel/) for checking pixel precision.\r\n* I already mentioned this, but [Google](http://www.google.com)!!",
